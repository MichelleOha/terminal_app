# MY WARDROBE Terminal App

MY WARDROBE is a terminal application that allows the user to enter in and store details about the items in their wardrobe so that they have a quick reference when they are shopping either online or in-store.

The user can enter new items, delete unwanted items, view their wardrobe and reset their wardrobe with this application.

Sizing varies so much across different brands and international sizes are different to Australia sizes.....When I shop for clothing or footwear online, I always find I have to run to my wardrobe and find an item of clothing from that particular brand so I can then go back to my order and select the correct size. The purpose of MY WARDROBE is to store that information for me in a json file so I have reference to is there and then, saving me time looking for it in my physical wardrobe.
